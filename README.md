I've created this program based on the last assigment we've had with my other colleagues,
this programs has two main parts, one is login to the system as a user or as an admin.
And the other is the user find the job he is interested in and choose between two different jobs, and take the interiew online with some simple questions when the user finish the test we will inform him how much is going to take to get an answer.


For the admin when he logged in with his credentials he can see the test that we're taken before and decide if he want to accept the particular individual or not.
The next level is the interview and he can arrange a meeting, and even insert day and time.




In the beggining my target was to create a program that can save the new user's username and password(in a txt file).The registration alone as a program is working but after a lot extra things that i've added into my program. I was getting a lot of errors and i couldn't resolve them so i decided to make my program a little more simpler because it wasnt working.

if you want to loggin to the program as an admin you need to type : 

username :  admin
password :  admin

if you want to loggin as a user please enter this :

username : dave
password : alex
